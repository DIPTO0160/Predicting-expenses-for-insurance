Health Expense Prediction Model

This project is a machine learning model designed to predict a user's medical expenses based on key demographic and lifestyle factors. The model utilizes pandas for data manipulation and scikit-learn for building and evaluating the predictive model.

Features Considered:
Age: The user's age
BMI (Body Mass Index): The user's BMI, which is a measure of body fat based on height and weight
Number of Children: The number of dependents the user has
Smoking Status: Whether the user is a smoker or not
Objective:
The goal is to predict the expected health expenses for a new user based on these features, providing valuable insights for healthcare planning and financial forecasting.

Libraries Used:
pandas: For efficient data manipulation and preprocessing.
scikit-learn: For model building, training, and evaluation.
This model serves as an introductory exploration into machine learning techniques and their application to healthcare cost prediction.
